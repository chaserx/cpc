# Rails Security

Guidance for implementing secure Rails applications, covering authentication, authorization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## Core Principles

1. **Defense in depth** — Layer multiple security controls; never rely on a single mechanism
2. **Secure by default** — Leverage Rails' built-in protections (CSRF tokens, output escaping, parameterized queries)
3. **Least privilege** — Grant minimum necessary access at every layer
4. **Fail closed** — Deny access on error; never default to permissive

## Strong Parameters

Always whitelist parameters — this is the first line of defense against mass assignment:

```ruby
def user_params
  params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :avatar)
end

# Never do this:
User.create(params[:user])  # Mass assignment vulnerability!
```

Nested attributes:

```ruby
def order_params
  params.require(:order).permit(
    :customer_name,
    :total,
    line_items_attributes: [:id, :product_id, :quantity, :_destroy]
  )
end
```

## HTTPS Enforcement

Force SSL in production — this is non-negotiable:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
config.force_ssl = true
```

## Quick Reference

| Vulnerability     | Prevention                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| SQL Injection     | Use parameterized queries                    |
| XSS               | Don't use `raw` or `html_safe` on user input |
| CSRF              | Keep `protect_from_forgery` enabled          |
| Mass Assignment   | Use strong parameters                        |
| Session Hijacking | Secure, httponly, same_site cookies          |
| Broken Auth       | Use Devise with secure settings              |
| Broken Access     | Implement Pundit or CanCanCan                |

## Security Scanning

Run these tools regularly and in CI:

```bash
bundle exec brakeman --no-pager        # Static analysis
bundle exec bundler-audit check --update  # Gem CVE check
```

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Secrets in credentials or env vars, `master.key` not in VCS
- [ ] `config.force_ssl = true` in production
- [ ] Secure session config (httponly, secure, same_site)
- [ ] Strong parameters on all actions
- [ ] Authorization on all actions (Pundit `verify_authorized`)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured (Rack::Attack)
- [ ] Security headers set
- [ ] File upload validation
- [ ] Brakeman and bundler-audit passing
